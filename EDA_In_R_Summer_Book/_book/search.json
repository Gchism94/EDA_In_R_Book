    "text": "1.1 Getting started with the dlookr R package: Exploring a novel data set and produce publication quality tables and reports\nExploratory data analysis is an essential first step towards determining the validity of your data and should be performed throughout the data pipeline. However, EDA is often performed too late or not at all. The R programming language, specifically through the RStudio IDE, is widely used open source platform for data analysis and data visualization. This is because of the extensive variety of packages available and attentive community devoted to data analysis. Consequently, there are several exploratory data analysis packages, each of which have their own pros and cons.\nHere, we utilize the dlookr package to conduct preliminary exploratory data analysis aimed at diagnosing any major issues with an imported data set. dlookr offers a clean and straightforward methodology to uncover issues such as data outliers, missing data, as well as summary statistical reports.\n\n\n1.1.1 What is exploratory data analysis?\nExploratory data analysis is a statistical, approach towards analyzing data sets to investigate and summarize their main characteristics, often through statistical graphics and other data visualization methods."
